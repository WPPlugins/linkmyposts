Much like a person reading a book would flip the page, this plugin allows you to display an unobtrusive link list of pages in your story.

== Description ==

Many Wordpress authors will write stories over long periods of time, encompassing multiple posts. Creating links from post to post, page by page can be cumbersome and readers navigating to these related posts can sometimes be difficult to understand. With LinkMyPosts, you (the Wordpress Author) can link all of your related posts into one “book” and display a friendly link list to your users while they are reading a post. This link list will intuitively allow them to navigate to the next or previous page, as well as jump to the beginning or the end.

1. Upload the contents of the zip file to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
